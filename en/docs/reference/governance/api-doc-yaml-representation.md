```yaml
count: 3 # Total number of documents attached to the API.
docs:
  - type: "document" # The type of document, usually "document" for text-based documents.
    version: "v4.6.0" # The version of the API manager.
    data:
      documentId: "62b16c62-67c8-4716-8144-322c9d64ef2c" # Unique identifier for the document. This is a UUID string.
      name: "How to document" # The name or title of the document.
      type: "HOWTO" # The type of document. Can be one of the following: 
        # - HOWTO
